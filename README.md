Whatsalyze provides a shiny app to analyze your whatsapp chats\! You can
easily import your chats as exported `chat.txt` files and get some fun
insights\! ðŸ•µ

It is written using the golem framework for production-grade and robust
shiny apps. The shiny app is embedded inside the structure of an R
package which allows not only a concise and well structured workflow but
also the integration of documentation (roxygen2) and tests (testthat).

## Installation

You can install the current version of `whatsalyze` from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EmanuelSommer/whatsalyze")
```

## Usage locally

The nice thing about running this app locally is, that your sensible
chat data does not leave the comfort of your own computer\! And it is
quite easy too\! Just run the following in your R console:

``` r
whatsalyze::run_app()
```
